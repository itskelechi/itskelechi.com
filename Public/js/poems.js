  Thatâ€™s not news\n
  The man next to me has been anxiously looking at his watch\n
  I wonder what song sheâ€™s lost to\n
  Her finger moves like sheâ€™s casting a spell, \n
  Their feet tap in rhythm \n
  Is it the same song?\n
  A baby cries on cue\n
  Start the drum solo\n
  Itâ€™s late. \n
  The impatience is deafening \n
  Itâ€™s louder than the woman arguing with her business partner \n
  Or the guy gushing with his mate\n
  Take your position \n
  It will decide your fate\n
  Itâ€™s late\n
  Do you think theyâ€™d notice? \n
  She looks like sheâ€™s never done this before \n
  Should I call you?\n
  Can I call you? \n
  Itâ€™s impossible to not notice the change in the earthâ€™s vibrations as it approaches \n
